          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Last updated: March 15, 2026</p>

          <p>
            These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of WeldCert&apos;s
            welder certification tracking platform, including our website, applications, and services
            (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Account Registration</h2>
          <p>
            You must create an account to use WeldCert. You are responsible for maintaining the
            confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account.
            You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Subscription and Payment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Free trial:</strong> New accounts receive a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card is required to start.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing:</strong> After the trial, continued access requires an active paid subscription. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually as selected.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time. Access continues through the end of your current billing period. No refunds are issued for partial billing periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Price changes:</strong> We may adjust pricing with 30 days&apos; notice. Existing subscribers are locked into their current rate until their next renewal cycle.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose</li>
            <li>Share your account credentials with unauthorized parties</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service</li>
            <li>Upload malicious code, viruses, or harmful content</li>
            <li>Interfere with the security or integrity of the Service</li>
            <li>Scrape, crawl, or use automated tools to extract data from the Service</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of all welder qualifications, WPS/PQR documents, continuity logs,
            test results, and other content you create or upload to WeldCert (&quot;Your Data&quot;).
            You grant us a limited license to host, store, and process Your Data solely to provide
            and improve the Service. We will not share Your Data with third parties except as described
            in our Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
          <p>
            You may export Your Data at any time in standard formats (PDF reports, CSV data exports).
            Upon account termination, you will have 30 days to export Your Data before it is
            permanently deleted.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Service Availability</h2>
          <p>
            We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may perform
            scheduled maintenance with advance notice. We are not liable for temporary service
            interruptions due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            WeldCert is provided &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available.&quot; While we design our
            platform to support AWS D1.1, ASME Section IX, and API 1104 compliance workflows,
            WeldCert is a tool to assist your certification tracking — it does not constitute
            professional engineering advice and does not guarantee regulatory compliance. You remain
            responsible for ensuring your welding programs meet applicable code requirements.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, WeldCert&apos;s total liability for any claims
            arising from or related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the
            12 months preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential,
            or punitive damages, including lost profits, data loss, or business interruption.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless WeldCert and its officers, employees, and
            agents from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service or
            violation of these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or engage in conduct
            that may harm our platform or other users. You may terminate your account at any time
            through your account settings or by contacting support.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via
            email or in-app notification at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use of
            the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of
            law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Harris County, Texas.
          </p>
